To test your combat skills, we simulated a situation where you are inserted behind the enemy line. In this case, right in the middle of an enemy fleet.

Your mission is to eliminate the enemy's fleet. T-One Actual will be your commander. Please conduct any necessary training if needed.

You will be injected with 0.5mg of benzodiazepines to conduct pre-combat analysis. Consult with your doctor about your current diet.
